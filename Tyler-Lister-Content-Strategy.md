### Caption 6: Adaptive Cruise
```
Set it and (almost) forget it 🛣️

Adaptive Cruise + Lane Keep Assist = your Equinox handling highway driving while you stay relaxed.

Road trip game changer. Who's tried this?

#Equinox #ChevyEquinox #RoadTrip #ChevyTips #GarberChevrolet #MidlandMI
```

### Caption 7: Tire Pressure
```
Your tire pressure light came on? Don't panic 🚗

Cold air = lower pressure. About 1 PSI for every 10°F drop. Fill to the number on your door jamb (not the tire).

#WinterTips #TirePressure #CarMaintenance #MichiganWinter #GarberChevrolet #MidlandMI
```

### Caption 8: Warm Up Myth
```
Stop idling your car for 10 minutes every morning ⛽

Modern engines only need 30-60 seconds. Extended idling = wasted gas + extra wear.

Mind blown or old news?

### Caption 9: Valet Mode
```
Your privacy stays protected, even when your car doesn't 🔒

**Lighting:** Face natural light (window or outdoors). Never backlit.

**Audio:** Quiet location. Wind ruins audio.

**Format:** Vertical (9:16) for Reels

**First 3 seconds:** Start with energy. The hook determines if people watch.

**Captions:** Add text captions in editing. 85% watch without sound.
