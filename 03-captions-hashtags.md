## Ready-to-Use Captions

### Caption #1: Remote Start + Heated Seats
```
Michigan winters hit different when your seats are already warm 🔥

Your Silverado's Remote Start can automatically heat your seats based on outside temperature. Start it from inside, walk out to a toasty truck.

Did you know your truck could do this? Drop a ❄️ if you're ready for winter!

```

### Caption #2: Key Fob Windows
```
This key fob trick will change your summer 👆

Hold the unlock button and watch all your windows go down. Cool off your car before you even get in.

Try it and let me know - did it work on your Chevy?

### Caption #5: Reverse Tilt Mirrors
```
Your car's been helping you park this whole time 🪞

The Reverse Tilt Mirror feature automatically angles your mirrors DOWN when you shift into reverse - perfect view of the curb.

No more guessing if you're close enough!

### Caption #6: Equinox Highway Assist
```
Set it and (almost) forget it 🛣️

Adaptive Cruise Control + Lane Keep Assist = your Equinox handling highway driving while you stay relaxed.

It maintains speed, keeps distance, and gently steers you back if you drift.

Road trip game changer. Who's tried this?

### Caption #7: Winter Tire Pressure
```
Your tire pressure light came on? Don't panic 🚗

Cold air = lower tire pressure. About 1 PSI lost for every 10°F drop.

Check your door jamb for the RIGHT pressure (not the tire sidewall). Fill when tires are cold.

Light goes away. You're welcome.

### Caption #8: Warm Up Your Car Myth
```
Stop idling your car for 10 minutes every morning ⛽

Modern engines only need 30-60 seconds. The BEST way to warm up? Drive gently.

Extended idling = wasted gas + extra engine wear.

Did you know this? Mind blown or old news?

### Caption #9: Valet Mode
```
Your privacy stays protected, even when your car doesn't 🔒

Valet Mode locks your:
• Center console
• Glove box
• Infotainment system

All with a 4-digit PIN. Set it up before you need it!

### Caption #14: Check Your Oil
```
60 seconds that could save you thousands 🛢️

Check your oil monthly:
1. Engine off & cool
2. Pull dipstick, wipe clean
3. Reinsert fully, pull again
4. Check level between marks

Too low = add a quart. Too dark = time for a change.

Save this for later!
